## Artwork

Since I am working alone on this project and many of you knows how time consuming is to draw and animate all of the models/sprites and create all the music, (especially if you are not experienced in this area) initially I will use a working/mocking artwork.
By the time this game is completed all the sprites/animations/music and artwork will be carefully hand-crafter to fit the unique gameplay experience.
