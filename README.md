## Intro

This project with the working name "2DPuzzlePlatformer" is a 2D platformer game that is carefully designed to be extremely fun and interesting to play.
This game is written in **Unity**.
The game will contain a unique playstyle combining some of the most important 2D classic mechanics with new unique ones.

## Story

**TBA**

## Artwork

Since I am working alone on this project and many of you know how time-consuming is to draw and animate all of the models/sprites and create all the music, (especially if you are not experienced in this area) initially I will use a working/mocking artwork.
By the time this game is completed all the sprites/animations/music and artwork will be carefully hand-crafted to fit the unique gameplay experience.
